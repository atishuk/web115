		<h1>Nastassia Tsishuk</h1>
		<h2>Web 115 Course Contract</h2>
		<p>I, <a href="introduction.html">Nastassia Tsishuk</a>, agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my Spring 2020 WEB115-85: Web Markup and Scripting with my instructor, D.I. von Briesen.</p>
		<p>I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal website will be publicly available to the world, and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.</p>
		<p>I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.</p>
		<p>Signed: Nastassia Tsishuk, 01/17/2020</p>
